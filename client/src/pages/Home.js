        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <p>
          Stop… and Take a Moment, and count to 7 in your head...In the time
          that It took you to count from 1-7 an Innocent animal waiting for a
          loving home was just put down.Every year 7.6 million pets enter
          shelters, and of these animals 2.7 million will be put down due to
          lack of resources. We are a Proud Supporter of PETA. PAWfriend was
          founded on the belief that we can change the odds that innocent
          animals are facing everyday. Help us to reach our goal, and save the
          lives of helpless animals. We donate a portion of every sale to help
          save an innocent animal's life. PAWfriend was created to raise money
          for these animals. We believe In the power of community and how
          monumental a community can become when it stands united. The founders
          of PAWfriend recognized after many years of working at a non-profit
          shelter that the only effective solution was to become an impactful
          force in educating people across the world "WHY?". Why is it up to us
          as a community to help save the lives of dogs and cats in shelters? WE
          are their only hope, is the heart breaking but honest answer. Due to
          the rapidly growing population of homeless animals, shelters around
          the world simply can't reach the financial demands to care for them
          all. That's where we come in, We are donating a portion of every
          purchase directly to the animals! We know how important it is to take
          a stand for those who can not stand for themselves. Countless animals
          across the country will start the New Year facing the saddest
          circumstances—abuse, neglect and homelessness. But your help can lead
          to more rescues, second chances, and safe and loving homes for animals
          who are hurting. Stand with US, and together we will stand for THEM!
